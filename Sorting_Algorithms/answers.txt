sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
    Time for sorting random50000.txt: between 5.60s and 5.54s
    Time for sorting reversed50000.txt: between 5.10s and 4.90s
    Time for sorting sorted50000.txt: between 0.46s and 0.38s
Time needed for sorting numbers does depend on the initial arrangement of the
numbers themselves: the lower and upper bounds are not the same.
Moreover, the running time for non-sorted(sorted) numbers is very high(low).

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:
    Time for sorting random50000.txt: between 0.51s and 0.41s
    Time for sorting reversed50000.txt: between 0.50s and 0.39s
    Time for sorting sorted50000.txt: between 0.47s and 0.39s
Time needed for sorting numbers does not depend on the initial arrangement of the
numbers themselves: the lower and upper bounds are the same.
Moreover, the running time is very low.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:
    Time for sorting random50000.txt: between 2.31s and 2.14s

    Time for sorting sorted50000.txt: between 2.24s and 2.16s
Time needed for sorting numbers does not depend on the initial arrangement of the
numbers themselves: the lower and upper bounds are the same.
Moreover, the running time is rather high.
