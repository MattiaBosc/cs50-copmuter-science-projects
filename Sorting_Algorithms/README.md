# Sort

## Overview
This project analyzes compiled sorting programs to identify which sorting algorithm they implement.  
The algorithms considered are **selection sort**, **bubble sort**, and **merge sort**.

## Objective
- Examine three compiled C programs (`sort1`, `sort2`, `sort3`) provided in the distribution code.  
- Determine which sorting algorithm each program uses.  
- Record your answers and explanations in a file called `answers.txt` inside a folder named `sort`.
