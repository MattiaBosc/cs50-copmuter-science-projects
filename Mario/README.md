# Mario Pyramid

## Overview
This project recreates the right-aligned pyramid of bricks from Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.  
The program prompts the user for the pyramid’s height and prints a corresponding pyramid using hashes (`#`).  

## Objective
- Prompt the user to input a positive integer for the pyramid’s height.  
- Print a right-aligned pyramid of hashes matching the specified height.  
- Re-prompt the user until a valid positive integer is entered.
