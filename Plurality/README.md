# Plurality

## Overview
This project simulates a plurality (first-past-the-post) election, where each voter casts a single vote for a candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.  
It demonstrates basic election mechanics and handling of invalid votes.

## Objective
- Allow voting for up to 9 candidates.  
- Record votes for valid candidates and reject invalid votes.  
- Determine and print the winner(s) of the election, accounting for ties.
