# CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science

## Description
This repository contains my personal implementations of the projects from Harvard’s CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science.  
The projects explore fundamental computer science concepts through C programming, Python scripting, algorithms, memory management, data structures, SQL databases, and web development with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## C Projects

- **Hello, World** – Prints the classic "Hello, World!" message.  
- **Hello, It’s Me** – Greets the user with their name.  
- **Mario Pyramid** – Prints a right-aligned pyramid of hashes.  
- **Cash** – Calculates the minimum number of coins for change using a greedy algorithm.  
- **Caesar** – Implements the Caesar cipher encryption.  
- **Readability** – Determines the U.S. grade level of text using the Coleman-Liau index.  
- **Scrabble** – Simulates a word game with letter scores.  
- **Plurality** – Simulates a first-past-the-post election.  
- **Runoff** – Simulates a ranked-choice (instant runoff) election.  
- **Filter** – Applies image filters (grayscale, sepia, reflect, blur) to BMP files.  
- **Recover** – Recovers JPEGs from a raw memory card image.  
- **Inheritance** – Simulates blood type inheritance across generations.  
- **Volume** – Adjusts the volume of WAV audio files by scaling 16-bit samples.  
- **Sort** – Analyzes compiled sorting programs to identify their algorithms (selection, bubble, merge).  
- **Speller** – Spell checker using a hash table to efficiently store and verify dictionary words.

## Python Projects

- **Sentimental Hello** – Greets the user by name.  
- **Sentimental Mario** – Prints a half-pyramid of hashes.  
- **Sentimental Cash** – Calculates change using the fewest coins.  
- **Sentimental Readability** – Analyzes text readability using the Coleman-Liau index.  
- **DNA Matching** – Identifies individuals based on STR sequences in DNA.

## SQL Projects

- **Movies** – Queries an IMDb-like database with SQL.  
- **Fiftyville** – Solves a mystery by investigating a SQL database.  
- **Spotify Songs Analysis** – SQL queries analyzing the top 100 most-streamed songs on Spotify in 2018.

## Web Projects

- **Trivia** – Interactive quiz website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Homepage** – Personal responsive website with Bootstrap.  
- **Birthdays** – Flask app with SQLite for tracking birthdays.  
- **C$50 Finance** – Flask and SQLite-based stock trading simulation with authentication, transactions, and portfolio management.

## Notes
- C projects were implemented with the CS50 library and compiled using `make`.  
- Python projects use Python 3.12 and standard libraries.  
- SQL projects were completed with SQLite queries.  
- Web projects use Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.  
- Each project has its own folder with source code and specifications.
