# Cash

## Overview
This project calculates the minimum number of U.S. coins needed to make change for a given amount in cents.  
It demonstrates the use of a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal distribution of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Objective
- Prompt the user to enter a positive integer representing the amount of change owed (in cents).  
- Calculate and print the minimum number of coins required to make that amount.  
- Re-prompt the user until a valid non-negative integer is provided.
