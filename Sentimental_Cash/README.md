# Sentimental Cash

This Python program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change, similar to CS50â€™s Problem Set 1. Users input the amount of change owed in dollars, and the program outputs the smallest number of coins required.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the amount of change owed (a non-negative float, in dollars).
2. If the input is invalid (negative or non-numeric), the program re-prompts the user until a valid value is provided.
3. The program calculates the minimum number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) needed to make that change.
4. Finally, the program prints the total number of coins.
