The Audio Aura of a user can be characterized by selecting the average of energy, valence
and danceability of the listener's top 100 songs from 2018.

In order to provide the listener with a more personalized 'Audio Aura', the latter could be
calculated by averaging over, not only the energy, valence and redability, but also the tempo
and loudness of the user's top 100 songs.
