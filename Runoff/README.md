# Runoff

## Overview
This project simulates a ranked-choice (instant runoff) election.  
Voters rank candidates in order of preference, and the program determines a winner by iteratively eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes until one has a majority.

## Objective
- Allow voting for up to 9 candidates.  
- Record votersâ€™ ranked preferences.  
- Tabulate votes and eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes in each round until a candidate achieves a majority.  
- Handle ties and invalid votes appropriately.  
- Print the winner(s) of the election.
