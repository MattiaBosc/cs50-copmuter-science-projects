# Caesar

## Overview
This project implements the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in a message is “rotated” by a fixed number of positions.  
The program allows the user to encrypt messages using a secret key provided at runtime.

## Objective
- Implement a program in C (`caesar.c`) inside a folder named `caesar`.  
- Accept a single command-line argument: a non-negative integer key.  
- Validate the key and prompt the user for plaintext.  
- Encrypt the plaintext by rotating each alphabetical character by the key, preserving case.  
- Output the resulting ciphertext.  
- Leave non-alphabetical characters unchanged.
