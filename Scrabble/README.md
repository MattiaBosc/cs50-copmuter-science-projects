# Scrabble

## Overview
This project simulates a simplified Scrabble-like game.  
Players input a word, and each letter has a point value. The program calculates each player’s total score and determines the winner or a tie.

## Objective
- Prompt Player 1 and Player 2 to input a word each.  
- Compute the total point value for each word based on standard Scrabble letter scores.  
- Print the winner (“Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” if scores are equal).
