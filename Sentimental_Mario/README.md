# Sentimental Mario

This Python program recreates a half-pyramid similar to Mario’s pyramids in CS50’s Problem Set 1. The pyramid is built using hashes (`#`) and aligns the bottom-left corner with the terminal’s left edge.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid (an integer between 1 and 8, inclusive).
2. If the input is invalid (e.g., negative, greater than 8, non-integer), the program will re-prompt the user.
3. Once a valid height is provided, the program prints a half-pyramid using `#` characters, aligned to the bottom-left.
