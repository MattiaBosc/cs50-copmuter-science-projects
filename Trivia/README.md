# Trivia Webpage

This project is a simple trivia quiz webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can answer both multiple-choice and free-response trivia questions.

## Objective

- Create a webpage that displays trivia questions.
- Allow users to select answers for multiple-choice questions and type answers for free-response questions.
- Provide immediate feedback: correct answers turn green and display "Correct!", incorrect answers turn red and display "Incorrect".

## Implementation

### Part 1: Multiple-Choice Question

- Use an `<h3>` heading to display the question.
- Include at least three buttons for possible answers, with exactly one correct answer.
- Using JavaScript:
  - Clicking the correct button turns it green and displays "Correct!" beneath the question.
  - Clicking an incorrect button turns it red and displays "Incorrect" beneath the question.

### Part 2: Free-Response Question

- Use an `<h3>` heading to display the question.
- Include an `<input>` field for user response and a confirmation button.
- Using JavaScript:
  - Typing the correct answer turns the input green and displays "Correct!".
  - Typing an incorrect answer turns the input red and displays "Incorrect".
